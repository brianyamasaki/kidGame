<h2>Try the game</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Clicking on a square immediately marks it with the current player's symbol.</li>
  <li>Changing a square from one player's symbol to another player's symbol is not disabled yet.</li>
  <li>Knowing when a player has won is not done yet.</li>
  <li>Indicating when the game is not winnable is not done yet.</li>

  <h2>Description of the Code</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>This game of Tic Tac Toe is created in the ticTacToe directory</li>
    <li>The game logic is in ticTacToe-directive.js and the game HTML template is in ticTacToe-directive.html.</li>
    <li>The value of each square of the board is represented by array items within <code>scope.boardValues</code>.
      While JavaScript array items will accept all kinds of values, the only values that actually work are
      <code>'x'</code>, <code>'y'</code>, and the special value <code>undefined</code>.
      Note that the board is initialized to be full of <code>undefined</code> values by copying from <code>initSquares</code>.</li>
    <li><strong>Note:</strong> The little number displayed on each tic tac toe square of the game itself is only there to help the coder to remember which item in the array
      represents which square on the board.</li>
    <li><code>scope.currentPlayer</code> holds the value of the current player, always either <code>'x'</code> or <code>'o'</code>.</li>
    <li>When the user clicks on a square, the function <code>scope.squareClick</code> gets called with an index parameter from 0 to 8.
      To mark that square for the current player do <code>scope.boardSquares[index] = scope.currentPlayer</code>.
      As an example, clicking on the top left square will call scope.squareClick with index equal to 0.
      If the current player is 'x', the correct way to display the board properly is to set <code>scope.boardSquares[0] = 'x'</code>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Exercises</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Change the <code>scope.resetBoard</code> function to start with player 'o' instead of player 'x'.</li>
    <li>Disallow clicking on a square that is already marked by changing code in <code>scope.squareClick</code>. You'll want to check immediately whether it's already marked.
      Give an error message by setting <code>scope.errorMsg = 'Cannot Click on this square'</code>, then <code>return false</code> before any other code is executed.
      If clicking on the square is allowed, be sure to set <code>scope.errorMsg = undefined</code> before continuing to execute the code.</li>
    <li>Finish the function <code>scope.checkForTie</code> by detecting for any squares that are <code>undefined</code>.
      Note that if you find <strong>any</strong> <code>undefined</code> array items, you can <code>return false</code> immediately.
      Otherwise, if you can't find any <code>undefined</code> array items, you should <code>return true</code>.</li>
    <li>Finish the function <code>scope.checkForWin</code> by checking whether any three in a row matches for the current player.
      There are eight possible ways to win - three across, three down and two diagonal. If any three in a row matches the current player,
      the function should <code>return true</code>. Otherwise <code>return false</code>. The simplest way to do check is to compare
      the array items with <code>scope.currentPlayer</code> such that three in a row are actually the same.
    </li>
