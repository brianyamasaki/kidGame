<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>This game of Tic Tac Toe is created in the ticTacToe directory</li>
  <li>The game logic is in ticTacToe-directive.js and the game HTML template is in ticTacToe-directive.html.</li>
  <li>The value of each square of the board is represented by array items within <code>scope.boardValues</code>.
    While JavaScript array items will accept all kinds of values, the only values that actually work are
    <code>'x'</code>, <code>'y'</code>, and the special value <code>undefined</code>.
    Note that the board is initialized to be full of <code>undefined</code> values by copying from <code>initSquares</code>.</li>
  <li>The little number on each tic tac toe square is only there to help the coder to remember which item in the array
    represents which square on the board.</li>
</ul>
